Finally, you can either confirm the bet or cancel it. Keep in mind that our General Terms and Conditions do not permit the cancelation of any bets once they have been placed.",
  "s-1-1-t": "What are the types of bets?",
  "s-1-1": "On Betnomi, you can choose among different types of bets. Starting with one prediction, you can use the Single bet option; with two or more predictions, you can place Express bets; with three or more predictions, you can place a System or Chain bet. All you have to do is to select the desired option.",
  "s-1-2-t": "What is a Single bet?",
  "s-1-2": "A Single bet is the simplest form of betting. You predict an outcome, specify the desired stake and place the bet. If your prediction is correct, you win the bet. The winnings are calculated by multiplying the odds by the stake.",
  "s-1-3-t": "What is an Express bet and how is it calculated?",
  "s-1-3": "An Express is a bet consisting of two or more events where none of the events should lose. If even one loses, then the whole Express will collapse. Total odds are calculated by multiplying the odds of all the individual predictions.",
  "s-1-4-t": "What is a Chain bet and how is it calculated?",
  "s-1-4": "A Chain bet is a combination of Single bets on events independent of each other. You choose the order of the bets included in the chain and the unit. The unit stake is placed on the first selection as a single. If this generates a return, the unit stake is deducted from the winnings and placed on the second selection, and so on until the chain is complete or all funds are lost. In case there are not enough funds left to cover the unit stake, the total remaining balance is staked and the chain continues.<br /><br /> For example:<br />Leg Event Stake Odds Outcome <br /> 1 event $3 2odd. Win  <br /> 2 event 1.5 Win  <br /> 3 event 2 Lose  <br /> 4 event 3 Win  <br /> 5 event 1.5 Lose <br /><br />As a result of the first event ~ $6 is generated, from which ~ $3 is transferred to the next event as the bet amount. The other ~ $3 is transferred to the so-called chain account. From the second event being won ~$4.50 is generated, from which ~ $3 is transferred as a bet amount for the next event, and the remaining ~$1.50 is transferred to the chain account to total ~ $4.50. As the third event is lost, ~ $3 is taken from the chain account for the fourth event, and only ~ $1.5 remains in the account. After the fourth event is won ~ $9 is generated, ~ $3 of which is transferred as the bet amount for the fifth event, and ~ $6 is added to the chain account that comes to a total of ~ $7.50. The fifth event is lost. This means that the winnings of this chain are ~ $7.50, i.e. the same amount as in the chain account.",
  "s-1-5-t": "What is a System bet? How is it calculated and how much is the minimum bet amount?",
  "s-1-5": "System is a bet that consists of at least three events. The program creates possible combinations of the events you have selected. For example, if you select a 2/5 system, it means that at least 2 out of 5 picks must be correct for the bet to win. The minimum amount of each bet depends on the selection of the system.",
  "s-1-6-t": "What is a Handicap?",
  "s-1-6": "A handicap is a head start given to a selection expressed in goals/points/sets/frames, etc., depending on the type of the competition. The handicap is offered by the bookmaking company and can be ‘positive’ (1), ‘negative’ (-1), and ‘zero’. For example, if you made a bet on Handicap 1(2) on a football match, this means you allowed Team 1 a 2-goal head start.<br /><br /><ul><li>If the match ends 1-1, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 3-1 and the bet will win</li><li>If the match ends 0-3, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 2-3 and the bet will lose.</li><li>If the match ends 0-2, then adding the handicap will produce a score of 2-2 and the bet will result in a push (stakes returned).</li><li>If the handicap is negative, you need to subtract rather than add.</li></ul><br /><br />Here are a few other examples of a handicap<br /><br />Bet W1 Handicap (-1) can win only when the home team wins the match by two goals.<br /><br />Bet W2 Handicap (1) can win only when the away team does not lose the match (draw or victory of the away team).<br /><br />Bet X Handicap (1) can win only when the home team wins the match by one goal (or when the away team loses by one goal).<br /><br />Bet X Handicap (-1) can win only when the home team loses the match by one goal (if the away team wins by one goal).<br /><br />Bet W1 Handicap (-2) can win only when the home team wins the match by three goals. Bet W2 Handicap (2) can win only in the following result of the match:<br /><br />A draw<br /><br />The victory of the home team by one goal<br /><br />Any victory by the away team.<br /><br />Bet X Handicap (2) can win only when the home team wins by two goals.<br /><br />Bet X Handicap (-2) can win only when the home team loses by two goals (or the away team wins by two goals).",

  "s-1-7": "A Hattrick bet means that one of the players of the two teams should score three or more goals during the match.",
  "s-1-8-t": "What do W1/W2, W1/X, X/W2, and other bets mean?",
  "s-1-8": "This type of bet is halftime/fulltime betting, where the first symbol shows the result of the first half, while the second symbol shows the result of the game. For example, a W1/W2 bet means that the first team won the first half but the second team won the game. W1/X bet means that the first team won the first half, and the overall game ended in a draw.",
  "s-1-9-t": "When I try to place a bet I get a message saying that I have exceeded the winning limit. How high is the winning limit?",
  "s-1-9": "Betnomi reserves the right to set various betting limits for all events, markets, and selections. You will be informed of any limits when you place your bet.
