In order to manage the geographical risks, Betnomi uses the following classification:",

  "10-13": "The transactions observed on user accounts for which it is difficult to gain a proper understanding of the lawfulness of activities and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered atypical (as they are not directly justifiable).",
